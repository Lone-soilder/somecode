hi biswajit ,

what are you doing ?

now we have committed this new file to the staging area with the command "git commit -m 'adding new document'".

git commit -m "adding modified new doc to staging area"

----- delete a file ----
1.  manually delete the file from folder
    then see git status - deleted mynote2.md [means you have to add into staging.]
    so add and commit again

2.  git rm mynote2.md 
    then see git status [deleted file in green color which means staging area also updated at a time]
    git restore -S mynote2.md  [to restore the deleted file from staging area to work area]
    git restore mynote2.md     [to restore the delete in working area]
