hi biswajit ,

what are you doing ?

now we have committed this new file to the staging area with the command "git commit -m 'adding new document'".

git commit -m "adding modified new doc to staging area"

----- delete a file ----
1.  manually delete the file from folder
    see git status - deleted mynote2.md [means you have to add into staging.]
    so add and commit again
